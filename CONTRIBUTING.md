We need help to see our vision turn into reality. Any help, big or small, with the code, idea, suggestion, feedback, typo, anything at all that you think would be of help, is most welcome and much appreciated.
If youâ€™re interested in the project, feel free to open an issue, create a PR, or just come say hi and tell us more about yourself [here.](https://github.com/janetchapman/contribute-Crowd2Map/issues/1)
