## Introduction
Crowd2Map is a project being mentored under the [Mozilla Leadership Training Program, 2017](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/mozilla-open-leadership-training-series) 

[Crowd2Map Tanzania](https://crowd2map.wordpress.com/) is a crowdsourced mapping project aiming to put rural Tanzania on the map, particularly to help protect girls from FGM. Since we launched at Mozfest2015, we have been adding schools, hospitals, roads, buildings and villages to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), an open source map available to all, with the help of over 5000 volunteers worldwide and 600 on the ground in Tanzania.  With minimal budget and no staff we have so far added over 2 million buildings and trained community mappers in 23 areas of Tanzania.  We have also been featured on [Al Jazeera](https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglish/videos/873491619459013/), [he Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/06/online-mapping-tool-gives-fgm-runaways-a-path-to-help?CMP=twt_a-world_b-gdnworld) and [Missing Maps](http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2017/02/20/fighting-fgm-in-tanzania/).  We have also set up a [Youthmappers](http://www.youthmappers.org/) Chapter at the Institute of Rural Development and Planning in Mwanza and Dodoma.

## Why does this project exist?
- Rural Tanzania is unmapped, even villages of 10,000 people may not exist on any map.
- FGM and other activists do not have maps of their areas which hampers their work protecting girls.
- Local Officials do not have access to maps of their areas, hampering development
- We are empowering local communities to develop the skills to make their communities visible and collect the data they need to develop their districts 

## What we are doing about it?
- For the last 2 and a half years we have recruited over 5500 online volunteers [mapping from satellite images](https://tasks.hotosm.org/contribute?difficulty=ALL&organisation=Tanzania%20Development%20Trust&page=1) - anyone with an internet connection can help!
- Training 26 community mapping groups across rural Tanzania and partnering them with online volunteers who input the data they collect in [Fieldpapers](http://fieldpapers.org/) and help them generate printable maps of their village and district

## What do we want to do next?
- We want every village in rural Tanzania that wants one to have access to a map showing the resources that are important to them and has the opportunity to work with global volunteers to develop relevant GIS and research skills.
